    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Make these Korean-style spicy pancakes made with gut-friendly kimchi and gochujang. They're packed with flavour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>200g kimchi</li>
        <li>2 tbsp gochujang</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, finely sliced</li>
        <li>6 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put flours into bowl, pour in 200ml ice-cold water and whisk until a smooth batter is formed.</li>
        <li>Mix in the kimchi, gochujang and spring onions.</li>
        <li>Place a large non-stick pan over a high heat with 2 tbsp vegetable oil. Ladle the pancake mix into the pan. Use the back of the ladle to smooth the mixture out to create a thin, even layer. Reduce the heat to medium high. Fry for 2-3 mins, until air bubbles start to pop on the surface and the sides start to crisp.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake then slightly lift the side of the pancake with a spatula and add another tablespoon of oil underneath â€“ shake the pan a little to make sure the oil coats the bottom of the pancake.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to press on top of the pancake to ensure the pancake is crispy. Fry for a further 2 mins.</li>
        <li>Flip one last time, pressing down on the pancake again and fry for 30 seconds. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the second pancake using the same method. Serve (optionally cut into bite-sized pieces).</li>
      </ol>
